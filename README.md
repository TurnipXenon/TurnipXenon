- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TurnipXenon
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game development and french fries.
- ~ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more game dev stuff aside from coding when I'm not busy ğŸ˜«~
- ğŸ“« I respond fastest at turnipxenon@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜» Also check out games I made with friends at [turnipxenon.itch.io](https://turnipxenon.itch.io/).
  - I recommend our game HepCat on [itch](https://just-a-phantom.itch.io/hep-cat) if you like cats and rhythm games. The source code is on [bitbucket](bitbucket.org/egginchicken/hep-cat/src/master/) ~wish it was on Github instead lol~.
