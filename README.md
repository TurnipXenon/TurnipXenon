ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I like to go by my pen name **Turnip**.

ðŸ‘€ I like game development, french fries, and seals.

- I recommend our game HepCat on [itch](https://just-a-phantom.itch.io/hep-cat) if you like cats and rhythm games. The source code is on [bitbucket](bitbucket.org/egginchicken/hep-cat/src/master/) ~wish it was on Github instead lol~.

âœ’ I've been trying out making a blog at [turnipxenon.com](https://turnipxenon.com/)
- If you're interested more on the coding stuff I do, I'll try write some interesting cases I've encountered at [turnipxenon.com/blogs/coding-chagrin](https://turnipxenon.com/blogs/coding-chagrin/)

ðŸ“« Contact me at turnipxenon@gmail.com, or through Discord at `turnipxenon (he/him)#3637`

ðŸ˜» Also check out games I made with friends at [turnipxenon.itch.io](https://turnipxenon.itch.io/).

Have some seal gif below:
