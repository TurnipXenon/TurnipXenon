👋 Hi, I’m @TurnipXenon

👀 I’m interested in game development and french fries.

~🌱 I’m currently learning more game dev stuff aside from coding when I'm not busy 😫~

📫 Contact me at turnipxenon@gmail.com, at my spam Twitter account [@turnipxenonspam](https://twitter.com/turnipxenonspam/) or through Discord at `turnipxenon (he/him)#3637`

😻 Also check out games I made with friends at [turnipxenon.itch.io](https://turnipxenon.itch.io/).

- I recommend our game HepCat on [itch](https://just-a-phantom.itch.io/hep-cat) if you like cats and rhythm games. The source code is on [bitbucket](bitbucket.org/egginchicken/hep-cat/src/master/) ~wish it was on Github instead lol~.
